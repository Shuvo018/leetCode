In computer science, the prefix sum, cumulative sum, inclusive scan, or simply scan of a sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, ... is a second sequence of numbers y0, y1, y2, ..., the sums of prefixes (running totals) of the input sequence:

y0 = x0
y1 = x0 + x1
y2 = x0 + x1+ x2
or 
Prefix sums are trivial to compute in sequential models of computation, by using the formula yi = yi âˆ’ 1 + xi to compute each output value in sequence order.

For instance, the prefix sums of the natural numbers are the triangular numbers:
input numbers	 1	 2	 3	 4	 5	 6	...
prefix sums	 1	 3	 6	10	15	21	...
